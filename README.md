Welcome to the Play Quiz Project! This is an interactive Java-based quiz application that demonstrates the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Users can take quizzes, answer questions, and receive immediate feedback on their performance. The project is designed with modularity and scalability in mind, making it a great example of how OOP can be applied in real-world applications.
